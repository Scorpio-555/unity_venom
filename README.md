# unity_venom

This is a personal project where I took the [Venom PNG](https://github.com/Scorpio-555/unity_venom/blob/main/venom%20master%20sprite%20sheet.png) that I found using google, and started making a platform video game using Unity. [Venom.cs](https://github.com/Scorpio-555/unity_venom/blob/main/Venom.cs) is the script written in C# that programs the player character to move, attack, etc. You can view a one minute demo video using [this link](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1157612/uiconf_id/42438192/entry_id/1_iapnwbz5/embed/dynamic). Note: the video is recorded without any audio.

Here are the controls:

| Button | Function |
| ------ | -------- |
| Left arrow | Move left |
| Right arrow | Move right |
| Up arrow | Jump/Move up (if wall crawling) |
| Down arrow | Move down when wall crawling/Drop (if on ceiling) |
| Space | Jump |
| W | Uppercut |
| A | Special |
| S | Kick |
| D | Punch |
| Hold Z | Activates alternate button functions |
| Z + Direction arrow | Run in that direction |
| Z + A | Heavy Attack #1 |
| Z + S | Heavy Attack #2 |
