# unity_venom

## Summary

This is a personal project where I took the [Venom PNG](https://github.com/Scorpio-555/unity_venom/blob/main/venom%20master%20sprite%20sheet.png) that I found using google, and started making a platform video game using Unity. [Venom.cs](https://github.com/Scorpio-555/unity_venom/blob/main/Venom.cs) is the script written in C# that programs the player character to move, attack, etc. You can view a two minute demonstration video using [this link](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1157612/uiconf_id/42438192/entry_id/1_s25oqqd9/embed/dynamic). This video shows the baseline functionality before changes are made.
